          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            This experiment attempts to make a landscape reminiscent of Yosemite
            National Park. Last summer I went to the park with my best friend
            and younger brother, and I loved the beauty and tranquility of the
            park, especially at night. I tried to capture some of that
            peacefulness here.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            Utilizing p5.js, this experiment creates various landscapes using
            the built in noise function. This function creates values similar to
            the one before it, allowing for a more smooth surface for the
            mountain ranges as well as the water. The stars and trees are made
            using a classes that randomly place them at the the start of the
            program. There's also a slight bit of movement with the water, which
            moves with the frame count. There is also a chance to see shooting
            stars in the night sky if you look long enough!

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            One of the tougher challenges I encountered during this experiment
            was with the mountain generation. I wanted to create two layers of
            mountains, with the one in the foreground being narrow enough so
            that the background mountains could be seen. I was able to find a
            way to have the foreground mountains slope downward about a third of
            the way through the page, although if you look closely you can see
            the slope is a bit too jagged. That being said I still like the way
            the mountains turned out. I also am happy with the way the night sky
            turned out. Originally I was planning on having the landscape take
            place during the day, but I decided to add some detail to the sky by
            making it night. This also gave me the opportunity to add the
            shooting stars, which I'm happy with. The water also turned out
            rather nicely, though I think I could've added more detail like
            light reflection to it. I think the least successful part of this
            experiment were the trees. I didn't really know the best way to add
            trees to the scene, so I just tried to add them in the transition
            from the grass areas the mountain range. But Yosemite has a lot of
            trees both on the mountains and the area by the water, so the lack
            of trees makes it less recognizable as Yosemite and more broad
            Sierra Nevada. I also wanted to add a waterfall to the mountain
            range on the left side, but I couldn't figure out how to make
            flowing water look good on the mountain range, especially since it
            generates differently depending on the seed so the waterfall would
            probably have to be placed somewhere differently every time.
